Dayflow – Human Resource Management System

Every workday, perfectly aligned.

Dayflow is a modern, role-based Human Resource Management System (HRMS) prototype designed to simplify and digitize core HR operations. Built as part of the Odoo Hackathon, Dayflow focuses on providing a clean, intuitive, and scalable solution for managing employees, attendance, leave workflows, and payroll visibility.

Problem Statement

Organizations often struggle with fragmented and manual HR processes such as attendance tracking, leave approvals, and employee record management. These inefficiencies lead to lack of transparency, increased administrative workload, and poor user experience.

The goal of Dayflow is to centralize these HR activities into a single, easy-to-use platform with clear role-based access for employees and HR administrators.
Solution Overview
Dayflow provides a structured HRMS interface where:
Employees can manage their attendance, apply for leave, and view payroll details.
Admins / HR Officers can manage employees, monitor attendance, approve or reject leave requests, and oversee payroll data.
The system is designed with a frontend-first, API-ready architecture, making it easy to integrate with a full backend or Odoo services in future phases.
